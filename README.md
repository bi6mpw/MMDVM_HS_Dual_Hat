# MMDVM_HS_Dual_Hat 2.0mini 成本与制造性改进2024-3-5
2024/3/5修改封装为0603，以满足手焊需要，至此各类型热点板几乎无需DIY基础。

本版本调改：

1.封装0402修改为0603，个别布局，个别位置，增强可焊性

2.个别元件参数调整

3.射频噪声问题不确定来源，调整布局、ldo调回原始

4.制造成本整体上涨15元内，除天线、晶振、单片机全部原件立创采购。每10-12片的单片成本约70元。（10-12片是撸板两次的量，建议不要全做，12片留个一两片，多层板有一定概率出不良品，这样可以搬板救）

2024/2/26 0603发现严重错误删除待更新
2024/2/13更新0603为主要元件的版本，未进行实体验证


# MMDVM_HS_Dual_Hat 2.0mini 成本与制造性改进

# MMDVM_HS_Dual_Hat
Duplex variant of MMDVM_HS_Hat
DB9MAT DF2ET DO7EN

This PCB uses the [MMDVM_HS](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS) by Andy CA6JAU. It has two ADF7021 onboard and allows for duplex operation with two time slots on DMR.

## Revisions

### Revision 1.0

Initial release.

### Revision 1.1

LEDs D4 and D5 interchanged to align with scan order. Solder jumper JP1 was added. It can be closed if the board is used on Raspberry Pi only. It ties BOOT1 to GND. BOOT0 is controlled via GPIO. The 2x3 pin header can be unpopulated in this case to save space. We placed two coils on U1 and U2 for experiments with extended VCO. These are L11 and L12 and they are optional and do not need to be inserted for UHF use. Testpoints TP1 and TP2 on backside allows the demodulator output SNR to be measured with #define TEST_DAC compiled firmware.

**This version is not recommended for (re-)production!**

### Revision 1.2

An accidentially deleted 3v3 wire has been added back to the PCB layout. BOM, Mouser cart and stencil stay the same as for rev1.1.

### Revision 1.3

STlink header has been refactored to have the same pinout as the [MMDVM_HS_Hat](https://github.com/mathisschmieder/MMDVM_HS_Hat) boards. OLED and STlink header have been exchanged. JP1 has been slightly moved. C44, C45 and C46 have been relocated nearer to the STM32F1 CPU. A table was added to the bottom silkscreen to show which TCXO is installed. This is important to the firmware. BOM and Mouser cart are still the same. The stencil has slightly changed. If you manually solder C44-C46 you can still use the old one.

## BOM

Mouser cart for rev1.0 is [here](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=561bb01347).

[This](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=24ea9d644e) is the Mouser cart for rev1.1. L11 and L12 are optional.

## Firmware installation

The device can be used on top on a RPi attached via the GPIO port or standalone and connected via USB. Both variants require different handling of compiling and uploading the firmware. The USB connection requires firmware with bootloader support whereas the GPIO version does not. 

For USB connection a bootloader has to be installed initally. This requires STlink connection. After that is done the MMDVM_HS firmware upgrade can be done via the USB connection. The STlink connection can be used as fallback if wrongly configured firmware was installed for example.

### Install the firmware with bootloader support for USB connection

If you want to use the device via USB port you have to install a bootloader and build the firmware with bootloader support. As the raw device cannot be used with USB you have to use a USB-serial adapter or STlink device. Using STlink this can be done as follows:

```
user@host:/opt/MMDVM_HS$ make stlink-bl 
././STM32F10X_Lib/utils/linux64/st-flash write ./STM32F10X_Lib/utils/bootloader/generic_boot20_pc13.bin 0x8000000

```

The device should now be usable as /dev/ttyACMx. 

If you want to update the MMDVM_HS firmware itself later on via USB you can use the dfu upload method. The settings in Config.h are:

    #define MMDVM_HS_DUAL_HAT_REV10
    #define ENABLE_ADF7021
    #define DUPLEX

    #define ADF7021_14_7456

or
    #define ADF7021_12_2880

for boards with 12.288MHz TCXO.

    #define STM32_USB_HOST
    #define ENABLE_SCAN_MODE

Optionally:

    #define SEND_RSSI_DATA
    #define SERIAL_REPEATER

Compile the firmware with "make bl" and then:

```
user@host:/opt/MMDVM_HS$ sudo make dfu devser=/dev/ttyACM3
././STM32F10X_Lib/utils/linux64/upload-reset /dev/ttyACM3 750

### Compile and upload manually for GPIO connection

For specific details about the firmware installation, check [these](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS#build-de-firmware-and-upload-to-zumspot-rpi) instructions. The process is similar to the installation on the ZumSpot Pi. You can make use of the preconfigured scripts in MMDVM_HS. Editing Config.h by hand requires these settings:

Enable the following settings in Config.h: 

    #define MMDVM_HS_DUAL_HAT_REV10
    #define ENABLE_ADF7021
    #define DUPLEX
    #define ADF7021_14_7456
    #define STM32_USART1_HOST
    #define ENABLE_SCAN_MODE

Optionally:

    #define SEND_RSSI_DATA
    #define SERIAL_REPEATER

And for 12.288MHz TCXO equipped boards

    #define ADF7021_12_2880

instead of the 14_7456 option.

Build the firmware:

    make

Make sure the two BOOT jumpers are set as follows:

    BOOT0: completey removed
    BOOT1: set to BOOT 1 -

And finally upload the firmware to the MMDVM_HS_Dual_Hat:

    sudo make mmdvm_hs_dual_hat

### Update within Pi-Star

[PiStar](http://www.pistar.uk/) contains a binary that allow for flashing precompiled binary firmware to the MMDVM_HS_Dual_Hat. To update the firmware within PiStar execute the following commands:

    $ rpi-rw
    $ pistar-mmdvmhshatflash hs_dual_hat

If you have a board equipped with 12.288MHz TCXO you have to flash the according firmware type using:

    $ pistar-mmdvmhshatflash hs_dual_hat-12mhz
